# Pomodoro

Simple Pomodoro timer for the command line

# What it is

A simple Bash script for tracking your pomodoros! Will write a log to ~/.pomodorolog with all your completed pomodoros, so you can keep track.

I wrote this for myself. It is an extremely simple script, you can modify it to your liking.

# Setup

You need to put the notification.ogg file in ~/.config. For convenience, remove the .sh from the script and add it to your PATH.

# How to use

In the directory where the script is, type `./pomodoro.sh -h` to get all the possible options. Or if you added it to your PATH, just do `pomodoro -h`.


# To add

- [ ] .config/pomodoro directory with log, config file, etc, as well as a better way to acess the log and count pomodoro time.
